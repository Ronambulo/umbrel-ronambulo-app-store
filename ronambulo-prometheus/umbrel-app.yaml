  Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. This app includes Prometheus server for metrics collection and storage, plus Node Exporter for collecting hardware and OS metrics from your server.
  
  Prometheus scrapes metrics from node-exporter running on the host and stores them in a persistent time-series database. Access the Prometheus web UI to query metrics, create graphs, and set up alerts.
